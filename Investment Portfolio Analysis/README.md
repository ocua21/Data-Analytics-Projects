# Investment Portfolio Analysis

**Purpose:** This project creates a tool that analyzes the performance of 3 distinct portfolio construction themes (Cap-Weighted, Equal-Weighted, and Risk Parity). This tool will allow the user to input a list of stocks, start date, end date and investment amount and will return the performance of each portfolio in the given timeframe.

**Background:**

1. **Cap-Weighted Portfolio:** The weight of each asset is directly proportional to the market cap of the asset compared to the total market cap of the portfolio. Naturally, this scheme allows larger companies to control the majority of the portfolio with the smaller companies having smaller shares, leading to lower volatility.
2. **Equal-Weighted Portfolio:** Each asset will make up an equal amount of the portfolio. In a portfolio of n assets, each asset makes up 1/n of the entire portfolio. This portfolio is very diversified and allows for any assets to make an impact on the portfolio, which carries increased volatility/risk.
3. **Risk-Parity Portfolio:** Each asset will have an equal risk contributions to the portfolio. The size of each asset is ignored and instead the volatility is used to determine the weight. The overall risk of the portfolio is flexible and can be configured for each use case.
